We never change the source CSS or JS files, so the Bamboo you linked to three decades ago will receive the newest updates.\r\n\r\n## 120 characters of code\r\nIt's simple to install. Just copy and paste the **120 characters of code** before the closing **`/head`** tag on all your website's pages and you are good to go!\r\n\r\n## Works on mobile devices\r\nBamboo is built to be responsive, so you don't have to worry about your websites looking ugly on your smartphone or tablet.\r\n\r\n## No license\r\nThat's the best part. Use, abuse, and reuse Bamboo like you made it! If you really like it, we ask that you pick up a [Built with Bamboo badge](http://jujubeweb.com/bamboo/docs/#SupportBamboo) and display it proudly on your website.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# How does it look?\r\nCheck out a [demo](http://jujubeweb.com/bamboo/components.html) (or \"kitchen sink\") of Bamboo before you get it.\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nHaving trouble with Bamboo?
